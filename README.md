# BloomFilter_SebastianFernandez

This is a Java implementation of the BloomFilter, which was developed as a small project work during the course discrete stochastics.

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. Because of its nature of being probabilistic, the Bloom Filter trades space and performance for accuracy.
